    /* Which is better em or rem or px?
     Here are a few general guidelines: Use px for small,
    fixed-size elements like borders or shadows. Use em for typography and other scalable
     elements that need to change size relative to their parent element.
     Use rem for scalable typography and responsive layouts that need to change size relative to the root element. */
